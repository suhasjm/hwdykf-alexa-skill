# My first git project: How Well Do You Know FRIENDS (Alexa Skill: FRIENDs Trivia)
This is my first project using Git so few things might not be the norms you expect. This project is based on the Alexa trivia template from here: https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-trivia and Jarkko Laine's tutorial with code samples from here https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-build-a-trivia-game-for-amazon-echo-in-under-an-hour--cms-26140

This project uses lamda functions to build amazon skill
